## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify distinct groups of customers using clustering techniques.
- Help marketing and business teams target customers more effectively.
- Visualize customer segments for actionable business insights.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Dataset**
- **(Optional)** Power BI / Tableau for dashboarding

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize/scale data
   - Encode categorical features (if any)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand patterns in income, age, and spending score
   - Use pairplots and boxplots to explore relationships

3. **Clustering**
   - Use **K-Means Clustering** for segmentation
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
   - Assign each customer to a segment

4. **Visualization**
   - 2D cluster plots
   - Spending vs Income scatter plots
   - Segment-based insights

---

## 📊 Example Questions Answered

- Who are the high-income, low-spending customers?
- How many segments can be identified based on purchasing behavior?
- What characteristics define each customer segment?

---

## 📈 Sample Output

- 🔹 Cluster 1: Young, high-spending, low income  
- 🔹 Cluster 2: Middle-aged, high income, moderate spending  
- 🔹 Cluster 3: Seniors, low income, low spending
